# **ResoGuard: Structural Resonance Monitor**
​Making Cities Safer, One Vibration at a Time
​Hi there! I'm Murugan, and this is ResoGuard.
​I built this project because of the heart-breaking news reports about under-construction metro bridges failing. My goal was to create a device that "listens" to a bridge's natural heartbeat (resonance) and screams an alarm before something goes wrong.

# **What does it do?**
​ResoGuard sits on a structure (like a bridge or even my study table!) and monitors how it shakes.
​Finds the "Sweet Spot": Every building has a frequency where it shakes the most (Resonance). My device finds and saves this.
​Smart Monitoring: If the structure starts hitting that dangerous resonance again, ResoGuard triggers a loud alarm and flashes a warning.
​Smart City Ready: After construction is done, the device can switch modes to control street lights via WiFi using an ESP32.

# ​**The Gear I Used**
​Brain: STM32F411E-DISCO (Cortex-M4)
​Eyes: On-board 9-axis MEMS sensor (LSM303DLHC)
​Screen: 0.96" SSD1306 OLED (To show live Hz)
​Alarm: Passive Buzzer 
​IoT Wingman: ESP32 (for future WiFi connectivity)

# **How it Works (The Science)**
​I used Digital Signal Processing (DSP). The STM32 takes raw vibrations and runs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
​Think of it like this: The FFT takes a messy "noise" and turns it into a clear "note" (Frequency). If that note matches the bridge's natural tone, we have a problem!
​Currently, the project is in Simulation Mode for the FOSSEE Hackathon demo, showing how the UI and Alarm logic react when a specific resonance threshold (14.5 Hz) is met.
#​ **Project Structure**
​/Src - All the STM32 C code (the magic happens here).
​/Inc - Header files for the OLED and Math libraries.
​/Hardware - My circuit plans (Si2300 MOSFET and Flyback diode setup).

# ​**Open Source Love**
​This project was built using 100% open-source tools:
​STM32CubeIDE for coding.
​CMSIS-DSP for the heavy math.
​KiCad for thinking about the PCB.
​Special thanks to the FOSSEE team at IIT Bombay for the inspiration!

psst I'm a total beginner and haven't completed any projects 100% yet but as i learn them thorough, one day I'll definetly complete them :)
